The purpose of the Foxfooding program is to get Firefox OS in the hands of
users. It encapsulates the logistical problems in distribution, gathering data
to better support the product team in making decisions, and interacting with the
community. It’s currently targeting employees only with our “test driver
devices”.

We will be opening up the Foxfooding program to core contributors soon, and we
recommend that you sign up for our mailing list and follow us on social media so
that you’re alerted when devices and other products are available.

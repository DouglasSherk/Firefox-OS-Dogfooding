Hello, foxfooders! We've launched this website and app so that we can reach you
more effectively and bring the community together. You can expect the following
going forward:

* News about the Foxfooding program, Firefox OS, and project happenings.
* Information about updates that we ship over-the-air to your foxfooding
  devices.
* Ongoing issues that we're tackling, where we are in dealing with them, and
  guidance on how to get around them.
* Other assorted information, like interviews and press releases.

If you have any feedback, please provide it to us! We always want to hear about
how we can improve.

We're really excited to build out the Foxfooding community with you! Remember,
none of this would be possible without your enthusiasm.
